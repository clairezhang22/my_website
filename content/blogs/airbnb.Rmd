# Project Description 

For our final group project, we build a model to forecast the price of an Airbnbs for 2 people to stay for 4 nights. Among all the great cities in the world, we choose to forecast the price of some Airbnbs in Berlin. Please see our step by step analysis below. 


```{r a0, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("/img/a0.png",error =FALSE)
```

```{r a1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("/img/a1.png",error =FALSE)
```

```{r a2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("/img/a2.png",error =FALSE)
```


```{r a3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("/img/a3.png",error =FALSE)
```

```{r a4, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("/img/a4.png",error =FALSE)
```
