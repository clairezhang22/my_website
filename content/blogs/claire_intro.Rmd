### Where am I from? 

I was born and raised in Chongqing, China. It is one of the largest cities in China with 20 million population. Let me tell you three things about my city: 

- **Food**: Chongqing is famous for hot pot and spicy food. There are so many tourists vising Chongqing just for the food. 
- **Weather**: It rains a lot. The weather is like Seattle in the U.S. or London in the U.K.
- **Mountains**: There are a lot of mountains in Chongqing, and one of the most popular activities during the weekend is hiking. 

### My Journey 

I moved to the United States when I was 16. I spent the past 7 years living in the U.S. During the first three years, I lived in Minnesota, which is in the Mid-West. Three facts about Minnesota. 

- **Snow**: It snows at least 6 months a year. Popular activities during winter include skiing. 
- **Biggest Mall**: It has the biggest indoor mall in the U.S. and there is an amusement park inside the mall. Part of the reason could be it is too cold there and people need some indoor activities during winter as well. 
- **Great Lake**: There are five great lakes. Although it is quite cold during winter, summer is quite nice. People can go hiking, canoeing or any other outdoor activities. 

After finishing high school in MN, I moved to Seattle for college. I obtained a bachelor's degree from **The University of Washington**. The mascow for my school is Husky. 


### Where I will be? 

The honest answer is I don't know. I want to be a world citizen and live in different cities during the early years of my career.
